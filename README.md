# Blackjack

Casino-style Blackjack game designed for Python!

- Allows multiple human players to play against a dealer hand
- Casino rules apply: Dealer hits on soft 17, and Blackjack pays out 3:2
- Allows for insurance, doubling-down and hand splitting

Known issues:
- Betting logic for doubling down after splitting a hand is incorrect
- Needs improvement to UI/UX
